    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup uncooked long grain white rice</li>            
            <li>2 cups water</li>            
            <li>1Â½ tablespoons lemon pepper, divided</li>           
            <li>1 tablespoon dried dill weed, divided</li>           
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>          
            <li>1 pound salmon</li>         
            <li>1 tomato, sliced 1/2 inch thick</li>        
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>     
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring the rice and water to a boil in a pot. Season with 1 tablespoon lemon pepper and 1/2 tablespoon dill weed. Reduce
            heat to low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place salmon in the skillet, and cook 20 minutes, turning once,
            until lightly browned and easily flaked with a fork. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Season the tomato slices with remaining lemon pepper and dill. Place the eggs and flour in 2 separate dishes. Dip each
            tomato slice in the egg to coat, then press in the flour, coating both sides.</li>
            <li>Heat remaining oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. Place tomato slices in the skillet, and cook 5 minutes on each
            side, until lightly browned. Serve salmon over the cooked rice, and top with fried tomatoes.</li>
        </ol>
